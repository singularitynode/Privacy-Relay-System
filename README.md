### 5-Minute Deployment

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/singularitynode/privacy-relay-system.git
cd privacy-relay-system

# 2. Generate certificates
./init_certs.sh

# 3. Launch infrastructure
docker-compose up --build -d

# 4. Generate tokens
./rotate_tokens.sh

# 5. Test system
curl -x http://localhost:3128 https://httpbin.org/ip
```

---

### System Verification

```bash
curl -k https://localhost:8443/admin/health  # Node 1
curl -k https://localhost:8444/admin/health  # Node 2
curl -k https://localhost:8445/admin/health  # Node 3
curl http://localhost:9000/admin/health      # Client Admin
```

## 🧩 System Architecture

```
┌──────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐
│     Client       │ --> │   Relay Node(s)    │ --> │    Internet      │
│   (Proxy Layer)  │     │ (mTLS + Tokens)    │     │   Resources      │
└──────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘
```

**Data Flow:**

1. **Client Request** → Local proxy (`3128`)
2. **Encapsulation** → mTLS + token-based encryption
3. **Relay Node** → Validation + policy enforcement
4. **Upstream** → HTTP/2 relay
5. **Response** → Encrypted return path
