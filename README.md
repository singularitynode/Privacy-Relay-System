Privacy Relay System

Enterprise-Grade Distributed Privacy Infrastructure
with mTLS, Token Authentication, and HTTP/2 Support






🚀 Overview

Privacy Relay System delivers a secure, distributed privacy network built for enterprises requiring verifiable confidentiality, traffic obfuscation, and policy-controlled routing.
It combines mutual TLS, token-based authentication, and HTTP/2 transport in a fully containerized, auditable infrastructure.

🔐 Core Security Features

Mutual TLS (mTLS) — Bidirectional certificate-based authentication

Rotatable Token Authorization — JWT-style tokens with TTL and audit trail

HTTP/2 Transport — High-performance multiplexed protocol

Comprehensive Audit Logging — Request-response visibility per node

Policy Enforcement Layer — Blocks RFC1918 and restricted network ranges

Docker-Native Deployment — Reproducible environments via Compose

⚡ Quick Start
Prerequisites

Docker & Docker Compose

OpenSSL (for certificate setup)

Python 3.11+

Deployment Steps
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/singularitynode/privacy-relay-system.git
cd privacy-relay-system

# 2. Generate certificates
chmod +x init_certs.sh
./init_certs.sh

# 3. Launch the infrastructure
docker-compose up --build -d

# 4. Initialize token set
chmod +x rotate_tokens.sh
./rotate_tokens.sh

# 5. Configure your client proxy
# Example system proxy:
# HTTP Proxy:  localhost:3128

🛠 Technical Stack
Layer	Technology	Purpose
Protocol	HTTP/2, HTTPS	Secure & efficient data transport
Security	mTLS, AES-GCM	Encryption & authentication
Container	Docker, Compose	Deployment & orchestration
Language	Python 3.11+	Async I/O and performance
Database	SQLite	Local audit storage
🔧 Advanced Operations
Token Rotation
# Rotate all tokens (24h TTL)
./rotate_tokens.sh

# Custom rotation example
python token_manager.py --rotate node1 node2 client --ttl 48

Health Monitoring
# Node health check
curl -k https://localhost:8443/admin/health

# Client admin dashboard
curl http://localhost:9000/admin/health

Audit Log Access
# Retrieve client audit logs
curl http://localhost:9000/admin/audit


Node audit logs are also accessible via mounted data volumes.

🎯 Example Use Cases
Enterprise Privacy

Internal network traffic obfuscation

Regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

Secure remote access or proxy isolation

Research & Development

API rate distribution and IP rotation

Automated testing or web crawling frameworks

Personal Privacy

Encrypted, location-obscured browsing

Privacy-enhanced internet usage

🔒 Security Posture

Built-in Protections

RFC1918 private IP blocking

Certificate pinning & strict verification

Token expiry and signature enforcement

Request size and rate limits

Production Hardening

Use CA-issued production certificates

Integrate secret management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

Enable strict CERT_REQUIRED mTLS mode

Schedule regular key & token rotation audits
